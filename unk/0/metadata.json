  "description": "This unlucky but resilient hamster earns +$1 per month. Covered in pixel bandages and leaning on a crutch, it symbolizes the lowest tier of the collection — humble beginnings with minimal yield. Despite its struggles, it carries a spark of determination that reflects the starting point of every investor’s journey.\n\nHigher-value hamsters showcase brighter effects, stronger energy, and magical enhancements, while this one reminds us that even the smallest gains can grow over time.",
